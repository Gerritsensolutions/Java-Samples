This project demonstrates the use of a binary hash tree. By hashing words in a text file or placing them into a binary tree,
the program displays statistical information about each word. The stock text file provided is getty.txt (a copy of the
Gettysburg Address). Furthermore, another text file is given (omit.txt) which is a list of words that ought to be omitted from
the final statistical analysis.
